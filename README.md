# Initial coding portfolio
Here is the initial draft of my coding portfolio site
It contains just one project for now: agent-based modelling

# [Project 1: Agent-based model](https://github.com/Jiinglelocks/Agent-based-modelling)
* Uses two script files which should be placed in the same directory, as well as a 300x300 grid of CSV's in .txt format. 
* Agentframework.py contains an environment generating function, an Agent superclass and a Predator sub-class
* Model.py is where the model should be run from.
* Makes use of BeautifulSoup webscraping to initialise agents/predators x and y values from [this data](https://jiinglelocks.github.io/Agent-based-modelling/Model/data2.html)
* Agents move freely around a torus environment, eating from it, sharing resources and reproducing.
* Includes rudimentary GUI.
